      p The <strong>CRTEP</strong> project will provide a workforce education solution for technicians who can safely and efficiently identify, handle, sort, track and catalogue composite waste stream material, diverted during the manufacturing process, for future use in secondary fabrication and manufacturing. The project will advance knowledge across multiple fields and industries as protocols and training pathways are created that provide technicians with the foundational knowledge, skills and abilities needed to handle composite waste stream materials, treating them as a new resource. Incumbent technicians will have the opportunity to enhance core skill sets, making them more competitive in the work environment. New students will benefit from cutting-edge curriculum. Industry will explore new roles for technicians, and new methods to reclaim and repurpose materials.
